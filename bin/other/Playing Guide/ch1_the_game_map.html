		<h1>Chapter 1: The Game Map</h1>
		<section>
			<img src="images/easy_difficulty_map.png" width="400" height="300" alt="A rendering of the game map in the game when playing on normal difficulty." />
			<p>Shown above is what the game looks like when you start it if you select the beginner difficulty level. Notice that at the top are the menu commands. These will be discussed in a later chapter. Taking up the majority of the image is the terrain map, which is the focus of this chapter.</p>
			<p>Each color used on the terrain map means something, and the wise strategist would take special note of what each of these colors represent:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A yellow tile indicates mountainous terrain. Neither ground nor air troops may traverse mountainous terrain, and you cannot build in mountainous terrain. Furthermore, shots will not pass through mountainous terrain.</li>
				<li>A dark blue tile indicates an ocean or another large body of water. While air troops are able to fly right over it, ground troops are unable bypass water. In addition, you are unallowed to build in water.</li>
				<li>A purple tile indicates a cave. Air troops are unable to fly over it, but ground troops can go through relatively easily.</li>
				<li>A light green tile indicates grassy terrain. Both air and ground troops are able to pass through grassy terrain with minimal trouble.</li>
				<li>A dark green tile indicates a forest. While both air and ground troops tend to have difficulty navigating forests, air troops are hindered by forests more.</li>
				<li>A turquoise tile indicates swampy terrain. While air troops have no trouble navigating swamps, ground troops tend to trudge through swampy terrain slower than normal.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are 4 other things that you should note on this map that are really important. These are the start and end locations of your enemies. (Note: Locations may vary based on the challenge level the game is played on, but the colors will stay the same.)</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In the top left corner of the terrain map, you should see a dark red (looks sort of brown actually) colored tile. Ground troops will enter the map from this tile. (The game marks this square with GS.)</li>
				<li>In the bottom left corner of the terrain map, you should see a dark grey tile. Air troops will enter the map from this tile. (The game marks this square with AS.)</li>
				<li>In the bottom right corner of the terrain map, you should see a light red (or something close to it) tile. Ground troops are trying to reach this tile, and if they reach this tile, you will lose health.</li>
				<li>In the top right corner of the terrain map, you should see a light gray tile. Air troops are trying to reach this tile, and if they reach this tile, you will lose health.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Your goal is to stop your enemies from reaching their goal. Failure to do so will result in you losing health, and if your health reaches zero (or less), you will lose.</p>
			<p>Notice that there are a few more items inbetween the menubar and the terrain map. A brief description of those items follow:
				<dl>
					<dt>Level</dt>
					<dd>This number indicates the current stage you are on. As this number increases, more difficult and large quantities of enemies spawn into the game. Your final score is moderately affected by how high of a level you can reach. Can you reach level 100?</dd>
					<dt>Difficulty</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>This game possesses a dynamical difficulty adjustment system that is summarized by this number. A value of 1.0 means that enemies possess their base stats (although enemy statistics are also influenced by the current level). <strong>This value is <em>not</em> the same thing as the difficulty you select at the beginning of the game.</strong> To differentiate between the two, the term <i>challenge level</i> is used to refer to the difficulty selected at the beginning of the game.</p>
						<p>The way the dynamical difficulty adjustment system works is that the game evaluates how well you are doing at the end of each level based on how much life you lost during the level. The more levels you complete in a row without losing life, the faster this value increases and vice-versa if you are losing. This value also increases faster on harder challenge levels.</p>
						<p>High difficulty values can cause the game to be very tough. It may be worthwhile allowing yourself to lose some life in order to reset the streaking mechanic of this system.</p>
						<p>Your final score is also heavily influenced by this value, so if you are seeking a new high score, try to keep this as high as you can.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Life</dt>
					<dd>This is your remaining health. You start the game with 20 life, and as enemies reach their goal, you lose lives. You lose when this number reaches zero.</dd>
					<dt>Cash</dt>
					<dd>You spend this resource to buy and upgrade towers. In general, you get a predetermined amount of cash after every level, so spend it wisely. Your remaining cash at the end of the game has a small impact on your final score.</dd>
				</dl>
			</p>
			<p>With this information, you should be able to play the game with minimal trouble. On the other hand, if you want to learn more, you can read the other chapters. Good luck!</p>
