		<h1>Chapter 97: Hints, Tips, and More!</h1>
		<section>
			<p>Are you struggling to do well at this game? If so, maybe this file will help you do better! Below is a list of hints, tips, secrets, and more that should help you to do better at the game! (<strong>Warning: Some spoilers exist here, so try to play the game without help before resorting to this help guide!</strong>)</p>
			<section id="general_tips"><h1>More General Tips:</h1>
				<ol>
					<li>Be sure to plan ahead. While money is plentiful in the early stages, it starts becoming scarce later on.</li>
					<li>Pay careful attention to each level. You can learn much about an enemy just by looking at the enemy's appearance.</li>
					<li>There is a lot information obtainable in-game. Use it to your advantage.</li>
					<li>Each tower is designed to have at least one major strength and one major weakness.</li>
					<li>Selling towers (and walls) only returns half of the tower's value back. Try to place towers correctly the first time.</li>
					<li>Several enemies have special abilities. What works against one enemy type may be highly ineffective against other enemies.</li>
					<li>Even if you lose the first time you play, you can always try again.</li>
					<li>Learn the map's terrain. Enemies move much slower in certain terrains compared to others.</li>
					<li>Each map generally has two entrances and exits. Make sure to cover both.</li>
					<li>Though you cannot block the enemy's path completely, walls are vital in allowing your towers to kill your enemies.</li>
					<li>Most enemies cannot move diagonally. Use this to your advantage.</li>
					<li>Is the game too slow? You can increase the speed at which the game runs by going to the actions menu.</li>
					<li>You can pause the game at any time by using the actions menu (or by pressing P).</li>
					<li>Have you tried using the mark tiles option in the towers menu? This feature is designed to help you plan ahead.</li>
					<li>Click on towers to see their coverage area. Make sure every square is covered!</li>
					<li>You can double-click on a placed tower to bring up information about the tower.</li>
					<li>There are two upgrade options for each tower level. Look at both before making a decision!</li>

				<ol>
					<li>As the name suggests, the Cheap Tower is very cheap. Remember, you get what you pay for.</li>
					<li>The Rapid-Fire Tower is a decent tower all-around. It focuses on dealing fast single-target damage; however, it struggles against enemies with high armor.</li>
					<li>Do not overlook the Destroyer Tower's usefulness. It excels against heavily armored and high health targets, and its long range allows it to snipe enemies for a long time. Just remember to cover its weaknesses as well.</li>
					<li>As the game progresses, the Splash Tower becomes more useful in dispatching large groups of enemies. Keep in mind its short range and vulnerability to air troops though.</li>
					<li>The Spray Towers are very effective. They combine powerful splash damage with strong utility effects. Be sure to position them well as they can only fire in a restricted arc compared to most towers.</li>
					<li>A good strategy for the Utility Tower is to sprinkle them throughout the map. Enemies gain resistance against negative status afflictions over time.</li>
					<li>You can learn a lot from an enemy's shape. There are three basic enemy types: scouts, soldiers, and guardians. Scouts are represented by triangles and tend to move much faster than other enemies, but they rarely possess armor. Soldiers are represented by rectangles; they possess some armor and move somewhat slower than scouts. Guardians are represented by ellipses and possess heavy armor, but they move much slower than soldiers.</li>
					<li>This game possesses a dynamic difficulty mechanic. If you are doing well, the game's difficulty will increase slightly. If you do poorly on a level, the game will get slightly easier. If you are doing really well, then the game will start getting significantly harder, and if you are doing really poorly, then the game will start getting significantly easier. See if you can find a way to take advantage of this information.</li>
					<li>Enemies have three states: walking, running, and injured. An enemy is in the walking state if their armor is still intact, and they are not in the injured state. An enemy is in the running state if they possess no armor (or if their armor has been destroyed), and they are not in the injured state. An enemy is considered injured if it loses a certain percentage of its health. An injured enemy moves much slower than a walking enemy, and a walking enemy generally moves slower than a running enemy.</li>
					<li>There is a surprise waiting for you on level 15. Don't let it catch you off-guard.</li>
					<li>Watch out for darker-colored enemies! They tend to have special powers.</li>
					<li>Expect a mini-boss level every 5 levels (except for levels 15, 25, and 95).</li>
					<li>Levels 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, 95, and 99 are boss levels. Be prepared!</li>
					<li>Walls are much more important on Experienced and Expert difficulty compared to Beginner and Intermediate difficulty. On Experienced difficulty and higher, the game tracks where enemies have been killed. Enemies will avoid areas with high death counts.</li>
					<li>Levels 90-99 are by far the hardest. Try to plan ahead early on, but also note that you will receive enough money from 90 to 99 to allow changes.</li>
					<li>The first 99 levels are not randomly generated. Use the knowledge of past runs to help you plan future runs!</li>
					<li>Levels beyond 99 are randomly generated. Prepare for anything!</li>
