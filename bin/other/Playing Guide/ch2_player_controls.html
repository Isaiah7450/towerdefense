		<h1>Chapter 2: Player Controls</h1>
		<section>
			<p>The controls for this game are fairly simple, although some of them may not be obvious due to lack of in-game information. This chapter of the playing guide discuss aforementioned controls.</p>
			<p>Across the top of the screen (when you open the game) are a set of menus. From right to left, they are: File, Actions, Towers, and in some versions of the game, Develop. Most of the actions you perform in the game are done by using commands found in one of these menus.</p>
			<p>The first menu, File, contains the following commands: New Game, Start Custom Game, Save Game, and Quit.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>New Game</dt>
				<dd>Resets the game state to its original state. You may also change the global difficulty with this option. (Sometimes, the global difficulty level is referred to as <i>challenge level</i> to distinguish it from the dynamic difficulty you see in the main interface. <strong>You may only have one game active at a time; starting a new game will cause you to lose your progress in your old game.</strong></dd>
				<dd>Shortcut: <kbd>CTRL + N</kbd>.</dd>
				<dt>Start Custom Game</dt>
				<dd>Starts a new game on an arbitrary map and difficulty. <i>This option must be unlocked first.</i></dd>
				<dt>Save Game</dt>
				<dd>Saves your current progress. <strong>Progress within a level is <em>not</em> saved.</strong> This option has no effect in the middle of a level.</dd>
				<dd>Shortcut: <kbd>CTRL + S</kbd>.</dd>
				<dt>Quit</dt>
				<dd>Exits the program and saves your progress. <b>Note: This is not the same as using the program's close button in the top-right corner. Closing the game that way will cause you to lose all unsaved progress.</b></dd>
				<dd>Shortcut: <kbd>CTRL + Q</kbd>. A confirmation dialog box will be shown if you quit the game this way.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The next menu, Actions, contains the following commands: Toggle Pause, Start Next Wave, Buy Health, Increase/Reset Speed, Toggle All Towers' Coverage, and View Global Stats.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Toggle Pause</dt>
				<dd>Pauses/unpauses the game. While paused, the game does not update itself; however, it will continue to respond to and accept user input.</dd>
				<dd>Shortcut: <kbd>P</kbd></dd>
				<dt>Start Next Wave</dt>
				<dd>Starts the next level of the game. <strong>Warning: You may not buy, sell, or upgrade towers during a level. In addition, you may not buy extra health during a level.</strong> Be sure your defenses are prepared in advance!</dd>
				<dd>Shortcut: <kbd>W</kbd></dd>
				<dt>Buy Health</dt>
				<dd>Purchases some health. <strong>Note: The cost of buying health increases each time you do it.</strong></dd>
				<dt>Increase Speed / Reset Speed</dt>
				<dd>Changes the rate at which time flows. Increase speed increases the flow of time while reset speed restores the original flow of time.</dd>
				<dd>Shortcut: <kbd>=</kbd> or <kbd>+</kbd>.</dd>
				<dt>Toggle All Towers' Coverage</dt>
				<dd>Inverts the showing/hiding of all towers' firing areas. (It is the equivalent of clicking on every single tower on the map once.) It also inverts the display of levels on towers.</dd>
				<dt>View Global Stats</dt>
				<dd>Brings up a dialog box that shows your highest score on any standard game as well as the highest level you have reached on each difficulty. <i>(Note: Statistics for custom games are excluded.)</i></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The Towers menu contains a list of all the towers in the game, alognside their costs. It also possesses a few additional tools. To buy a tower, click on a valid square on the game map. If the action succeeds, you should see your tower appear in the location you picked. To sell a tower, right click on a tower that is already in the game; you will get half of the tower's purchase price back. If you left-click on an already placed tower once, you will be able to see the maximum area that the tower covers. Click the tower again (slowly) to stop showing the tower's coverage. Double-clicking a placed tower will bring up its info dialog and allows you to sell or upgrade the tower. A description of the first few options follows:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Show Info</dt>
				<dd>Selecting this option while a tower is selected in the Towers menu will open up the tower's info dialog providing information about the tower's stats. Read the next chapter of the guide to learn more about the displayed information.</dd>
				<dt>Mark Tiles</dt>
				<dd>This option allows you to select tiles to have the game highlight for you. This is useful if you want to plan ahead. <strong>Warning: The game does not currently save marked tile locations. If you exit and reopen the game, you will have to mark the tiles again.</strong></dd>
				<dt>Unmark Tiles</dt>
				<dd>This option removes the highlighting from tiles you have previously marked with the Mark Tiles option.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Below is the list of the towers in the game and their strengths and weaknesses (this may be outdated):</p>
			<p>Note that clicking a tower once also display the tower's current level on top of it in a purplish color. (I apologize for the poor contrast.)
			<ul>
				<li>Wall - This is not actually a tower, but like all towers, it has the benefit of blocking the enemy from entering the space where the wall is located. Be warned though, you cannot completely block off any enemy's path to the goal!</li>
				<li>Cheap Tower - This tower has the advantage of being inexpensive; however, it is inferior to the Rapid-Fire Tower in all ways. It is very inaccurate and deals low damage.</li>
				<li>Rapid-Fire Tower - This tower shoots many low damage projectiles at the enemy. Its strengths include a good range and a fast rate of fire. Its weaknesses include limited splash damage and inabiity to effective pierce through armor. It also prioritizes enemies with the weakest armor first, so use that fact to your advantage!</li>
				<li>Destroyer Tower - This tower weakens strong enemies so that other towers can finish them off; thus, it targets enemies with the highest health first. Its strengths include a very long range, high damage per shot, and a high degree of armor penetration. Its weaknesses include its extremely slow firing speed and lack of splash damage.</li>
				<li>Splash Tower - This tower is great at taking out hordes of weak enemies, and it is effective against groups of stronger enemies as well. Its primary strength is its ability to deal moderate amounts of splash damage. Its weaknesses include limited ammunition before reloading, a long reload time, and a short range.</li>
				<li>Spray Tower NE - This tower fires projectiles differently from other towers; thus, it tends to miss much more. While most towers fire projectiles directly at the enemy, this tower fires its projectiles in a pre-defined pattern going from directly north of the tower to directly east of the tower. Keep this in mind when you are placing the tower! Its strengths are its fast fire rate and bonus effects (Fire DoT and slow effect). Its weaknesses included limited ammunition before having to reload, limited arc and poorer accuracy (remember, it shoots from straight north to straight east), and limited firing range.</li>
				<li>Spray Tower SE - This tower functions almost entirely the same as the Spray Tower NE tower, except it fires its projectiles from directly east to directly south.</li>
				<li>Utility Tower - This tower supports other towers; however, it is also formiddable by itself. Its strengths include a wide variety of projectiles with different special effects (Poison DoT, slow effect, stun effect) and moderate stats. Its primary weakness is that most of its shots do not deal much direct damage. It also targets the deadliest enemies, that is, the enemies that are most likely to make you lose, first.</li>
				<li>Sky Tower - This tower is highly effective against air troops, but it is very ineffective against ground troops. It possesses a large firing area, prioritizes the mainstream air troops, and deals heavy damage to air troops. Its disadvantages include a slow rate of fire, ineffectiveness against ground troops, and limited splash projectiles.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you click View Info in the Towers menu, you will see a dialog box giving more detailed information about the currently selected tower's statistics.</p>
			<p>There are two other menus: Shots and Enemies. The Shots menu lists the names of all the various types of ammunition that your towers may fire. (You can view the info of a tower to learn what kinds of ammunition it fires.) Clicking on an entry will display more detailed information about the ammunition type. The Enemies menu starts out with all entries hidden, but as you complete levels and meet new enemy types, entries in the Enemies menu will be revealed. You can click on a revealed entry in the Enemies menu to see more detailed information about the enemy type.</p>
			<p>If you double-click on a placed tower, you will receive information about the tower similar to what appears when you use view info in the Towers menu. This popup also allows you to sell the tower in question and to upgrade the tower if applicable.</p>
			<p>Note that for each upgrade level of a tower, there are two choices: upgrade option a and upgrade option b. Clicking one of the two buttons will show more information about the upgrade details; click on "Do Upgrade" on that dialog box to actually upgrade the tower. You cannot reverse any upgrade decisions, so choose carefully!</p>
			<p>During a wave, if you click on an enemy, you will see information about that enemy similar to what you see if you click the appropriate entry in the Enemies menu.</p>
			<p>The game also has a few keyboard shortcuts that map to some of the menu commands. They are listed (again) below:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>[CTRL] + N: New Game</li>
				<li>[CTRL] + S: Save Game</li>
				<li>[CTRL] + Q: Quit (This shortcut carries with it a confirmation box.)</li>
				<li>P: Toggle Pause</li>				
				<li>W: Start Next Wave</li>
				<li>= or +: Increase Speed/Reset Speed</li>
			</ul>
