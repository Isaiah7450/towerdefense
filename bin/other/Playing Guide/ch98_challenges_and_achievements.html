		<h1>Chapter 98: Challenges and Achievements</h1>
		<section>
			<p>This chapter is devoted to giving suggestions of interesting challenges to vary up the game if you get bored playing the game normally. They are grouped roughly by their difficulty. A number indicated in parenthesis is a point value. While the game will not track any of this information for you (as of right now), you can sum up all the point values for challenges that you've completed in a game to get an achievement score. How high of a score can you achieve?</p>
			<p>Note that the difficulty groupings are based on the difficulty of the challenge and do not mandate playing at a specific global difficulty.</p>
			<p>There are no guarantees that any of these challenges are doable. If you believe a challenge is impossible, consider sending the game's author an email; however, there are no guarantees that a change will be made.</p>
