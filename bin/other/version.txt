Version 1.0:
- Initial game version (coded in Java)

Version 1.0.1:
Version 1.0.2:
Version 1.1.0:
Version 1.1.1:
Version 1.2.0:
Version 1.3.0:
- Information no longer relevant (still the Java version of the game)

Version 2.0:
- Never released.
- Rewrite of the original version.
- Game is now coded in C++ and only works on Windows now (You need DirectX).
- There was an interesting "Shockwave" tower in this version where it sent out
  pulses. As interesting as it was, I decided against adding it to the third
  version (in part because it was also kinda overpowered.)

Version 3.0
- A complete rewrite of the C++ version, but still in C++.
- This version was designed with multi-threading in mind; in practical terms, this means that the game should be faster and be more responsive to user input. (Note that "should be" is not the
same as "is". I make no guarantees that this version works better.)
- Things in the Java version that haven't made it into the C++ version (primarily because they are a pain to implement in C++ compared to Java):
 + Challenge levels and different maps based on the challenge level. (The infrastructure for this is there; I just need to make the GUI...)
 + The ability to get in-game info about towers, shots, and enemies. (Again, this is because making GUI in C++ is not easy.)
 + The ability to upgrade towers. (Again, this isn't implemented because it requires me making a GUI for it.)
 + The ability to purchase health. (It just isn't something I gotten to yet.)
- New features implemented in the C++ version:
 + A pause feature that is 100% reliable. (The Java one was not reliable, and I think I removed it in a later version.)
 + More reliable and consistent saving. (I believe the Java version only saved when you exited the game--not very reliable!) (Still not 100% reliable.)
 + Towers now have different firing methods and targeting strategies.
  * Firing methods determine the way the tower shoots; towers can shoot in predefined angles or choose a target to shoot at. (The latter is the default.)
  * Targeting strategies determine the way the tower obtains targets; it's irrelevant for all firing methods except the default one. Basically, it determines which enemies the tower shoots at first.
 + Enemy pathfinding AI is a little bit smarter now. The enemy will now attempt to avoid paths where many enemies have died in the past.
- Features that were changed/updated/modified in the C++ version: (Some of these are more coding-related)
 + Everything is now handled in terms of logical frames. (Previously, some things like DoT effects were handled in exact milliseconds which was part of the reason the pause function did not work properly.)
  * There are 120 logical frames in a single second.
  * Configuration values are still generally specified in terms of milliseconds for consistency and ease.
  * The game is drawn at a different framerate; the target drawing framerate is between 50 to 60 drawing frames per second.
 + Enemies can now possess multiple passive buffs. (Previously, they could only possess a single buff type.)
  * Two new buffs, Purify and Healing, have also been added. The former periodically removes negative status effects from enemies. The latter periodically heals enemies for a flat amount of health (not percentage based).
 + Enemy armor and weapon piercing work slightly differently now:
  * Enemy armor absorption was removed.
  * Enemy armor reduction now completely blocks the amount that it reduces (rather than distributing it to its armor health and the rest to the enemy's base health).
  * Weapon armor piercing basically reduces armor reduction and also damages the enemy in addition to its armor.
 + A new data file format is being used for configuration data.
  * This new format is more readable, consistent, and easier to use.
 + The game is more flexibility in what is and isn't allowed.
  * This is more of an implementation detail.
  * Waves of enemies no longer have to be of the same color.
  * More fine control over who is and who is not affected by an enemy's buff that is not based on color.
 + Prices no longer scale with difficulty. (Rationale: This was silly and just made the game more complicated without adding anything of value.)
 + Enemy speed no longer scales with difficulty. (Rationale: This was also silly and a bit ridiculous.)
 + Enemies possess two new statistics: injured movement speed and pain tolerance. An enemy that has lost a higher percentage of health than its pain tolerance are considered injured and move at the injured movement speed.
 + The number of enemies spawned in an enemy group is no longer random and is based on the game's challenge level.
 + Initial paths for enemies are found at the beginning of the level, and to improve performance, only one path is found (though the pathfinder is copied, not shared) for each enemy group (which are still of homogeneous type).
 + Path recalculations are still slow, but they should work more reliably now versus how they did in the Java version.
 + It should go without saying that practically everything got rebalanced since I rewrote the game from scratch.

Version 3.0.1:
- Bug Fixes:
 + Fixed stun not being removed from an enemy when status effects were purified.
 + Fixed warnings related to 64-bit code.
- Balance Changes:
 + Adjusted the health and armor of Purple Medic.
  * Purple Medic: Health decreased from 45 to 40.
  * Purple Medic: Armor Health decreased from 10 to 8.
 + Purple Medic can now self-heal.
 + Adjusted the power of some of Purple Medic's healing buffs.
  * Purple Medic: "Purple Medic Group" (Healer 2) delay increased from 7500ms
                                                  to 8000ms.
  * Purple Medic: "Purple Infantry Group" (Healer 1) delay increased from 750ms
                                                     to 800 ms.
- Did I ever release this version? Probably not--oh well.

Version 3.1.0:
- Bug Fixes:
 + A few code analysis (i.e.: code quality checks; not game-breaking by
   any means, but best practices) warnings/errors have been fixed.
 + Corrected a minor grammatical error in Purple Scout's description.
 + An issue with some pathfinding debugging code and loading a saved file.
 + Fixed the targeting of the spray towers.
 + Fixed a slight comparison error when loading enemy types.
- Balance Changes:
 + Money is now gained more consistently rather than varying by the number
   enemies in a wave. (This is way simpler and easier to balance in theory.)
 + Every level has been rewritten. (That's what happens when I stop working
   on a project for awhile and then get back to it. I have a habit of
   redoing everything. Still, I hope this time, balance will seem a bit more
   consistent and all.) (Levels 1-21 were changed.)

- Balance Changes:
- New Stuff:
 + Another chapter has been added to the playing guide. It is not exactly

 + You can now upgrade towers. (Note: At this point, all the features from the
   Java version have been implemented in some way in this version of the

 + Updated the readme file to include more information.
 + Towers now show the average shot effect rating on the dialog box, rather
   the average shot rating.

   was to fix a bug as well as add some content.)

   labeled as "Cost" is now labeled as "Value".
 + Pain tolerance range changed from 0-1 exclusive to 0-1 inclusive.

   way upgrade data is stored.
 + Decreased maximum allowed value for firing_speed from 90 to 60 due to
   certain game constraints.
 + Adding maximum value of 30.5 for firing_range because most maps aren't
   going to exceed 60x60.

   used later.

              15000ms to 11000ms.
 + Changed "Arc Circle" to decrease the number of shots required to complete
   a full rotation. This should lead to slightly better accuracy for the
   Cheap Tower.
- New Stuff:
 + The "New Map" option for the Terrain Editor has been updated. You can now
   specify the map's dimensions as well as the map's new name.
 + The Terrain Editor will now display the name of the map being edited in
   brackets ([]) at the end.

   continue to read old save file version (1 <= v <= 3) as well as
   version 4 files. (Added to accomodate changes to the terrain editor.)
 + The Terrain Editor has been decoupled from the game. (In other words,
   changing the map in the terrain editor no longer affects the map
   in the game.)
 + Made Blue Supporter, Blue Quartermaster, and Blue King/Vengeful King
   have darker colors to aid differentiation.

   what the currently loaded game possesses.

   of "Open map" in the title.

   saving the wrong map name.)
 + Fixed excluding "Blue Tyrant King" from "Blue All Group".
 + Fixed shapes not being scaled properly in the game.
 + Fixed some broken keybinds.
 + Fixed a text scaling issue on larger maps. (Note: Terrain weight text
   has not been scaled.)
 + Fixed an error where the program copied its resource file on each launch
   rather than only once.
- Balance Changes:
 + Changed the cost multiplier of buying health from 1.05x to 1.15x.
 + Adjusted enemy status resistance such that it lasts for slightly shorter
   periods of time. It also builds up slightly slower.

   difficulties and more impact at lower difficulties.

    ridiculous amounts at certain points.

   level and difficulty modifier.

    repeat playthroughs will have a similar level of difficulty.
  * Load fails that occur before the threshold level still load the backup
    level rather than generating a new level. (Failure to load the backup
    will generate a level anyway alongside producing a warning message.)
